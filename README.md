https://theisen92.github.io/05-Week-Daily-Planner/daily-planner.html

## Usage

Setting up a day to day schedule

## Credits

I primarily used the information from MDN Developer and full stack for resources. I also used moment js for the day and time

## Contributing

I worked on the project alone.

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project was switching the divs into textareas then back, updating the background colors and storing the data when reloaded.
I managed to find a way to update the textareas and progress the time. But I wasn't able to figure out the local storage and how to display it in the time slots.
I'm planning on going over it with a TA durring next class so hopfully we'll get it figured out.
