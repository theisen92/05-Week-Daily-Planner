Daily Planner
https://theisen92.github.io/05-Week-Daily-Planner/daily-planner.html

## Usage

Setting up a hourly tasks to keep up with daily goals or work dead-lines

## Credits

I primarily used the information from MDN Developer and full stack for resources. I also used moment js for the day and time

## Contributing

I worked on the project by myself with help from Nate and Johnny.

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project was updating the background colors and storing the data when reloaded.
I managed to find a way to update the textareas and progress the time. Although I feel there is a simpler way using nextAll and prevAll.
I was also having a hard time figuring out the local storage and how to display it in the time slots after reload.
I went over it with a TA during after class with Nate and Johnny and I was making it a lot more complicated then it had to be.
They were able to give me good next steps and worked through getting one of the time slots working.
